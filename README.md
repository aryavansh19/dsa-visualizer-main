[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE) ## 🌟 Introduction

This project, **Data Structure Visualizer**, aims to create an interactive web application using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** to help learners grasp the fundamental concepts of data structures through engaging visual animations and real-time user interaction. By offering a hands-on interface, this tool bridges the gap between theoretical learning and practical understanding, making abstract data structures tangible and encouraging experimentation.

Users can input data, choose operations like insertion or deletion, and instantly see how the data structure changes dynamically on screen.

## 🚀 Features

* **Interactive Visualizations:** Witness data structures come alive with dynamic animations for operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
* **Real-time Feedback:** Instantly see changes to the data structure as you interact with it.
* **Modular Components:** Each data structure (Linked List, Queue, Tree) is implemented as an independent React component, ensuring clean code and scalability.
* **Responsive UI:** Styled with Tailwind CSS, the visualizer ensures a seamless experience across different screen sizes.
* **Intuitive Controls:** Type-safe input validation and user-friendly controls provide an engaging learning experience.
* **Toast Notifications:** Immediate feedback for errors and successful actions using `react-hot-toast`.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Codebase separates logic from configuration, linking each data structure to a dedicated data file containing STL code, custom implementation, and documentation.

### 💻 Currently Supported Data Structures & Algorithms

* **Singly Linked Lists** (Visualization with animations for insert/delete operations)
* **Queues** (Visualization with animations for enqueue/dequeue operations)
* **Basic Trees** (Visualization with add/search functionality)
* **Binary Tree Visualizer**
* **Graph Data Structure** (and dynamic node/edge visualization)
* **Code Editor Integration with Command Parsing**

### 🔮 Planned Future Enhancements

* Circular Linked Lists Visualization
* Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and AVL Trees (with rotation animations)
* Graph Traversal Algorithms: BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search)
* Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm Visualization
* Full Testing and Final App Validation

## 🏗️ Project Approach & Architecture

The project is developed using **React.js** for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces and **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-first styling.

* **Modularity:** Each data structure is implemented as an independent React component to maintain modularity and simplify future expansions.
* **State Management:** User interactions are managed using React's `useState` hook, allowing real-time updates to the UI as users perform operations like insertion or deletion.
* **Dynamic Visuals:** Visual components represent individual nodes or elements, styled with Tailwind and updated dynamically to reflect changes.
* **Input Validation:** Input types are validated against predefined formats (e.g., Number, Character) to ensure data consistency.
* **Code Organization:** The codebase separates logic from configuration, with each data structure linked to a dedicated data file containing STL code, custom implementation, and documentation. This structure supports scalability and clean code organization.

## 📊 Project Status

The project is currently around **60-70% complete**, with core data structure visualizations successfully implemented and fully functional for Singly Linked Lists, Queues, and Basic Trees.

* **Completed:**
    * React project setup with routing and base UI components.
    * Singly Linked List, Queue, and Basic Tree visualizers are fully functional, with animated visual feedback, input validation, and real-time user interaction integrated into a responsive UI.
    * Application's foundational architecture, including modular React components, routing, dynamic state management, and data-driven configuration files, is in place.
    * UI elements and reusable components are ahead of schedule.
    * Responsive UI and Styling.
    * Code Editor Integration with Command Parsing.
* **In Progress:**
    * Animation logic for Trees (currently being reviewed).
    * Advanced modules including Circular Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees (BSTs), AVL Trees, and Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm).
* **Pending:**
    * Algorithm output testing for BST, AVL, and Graphs.
    * Final testing and validation.

## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to get the Data Structure Visualizer up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** or **yarn** (Node.js package manager)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aryavansh19/dsa-visualizer-main.git](https://github.com/aryavansh19/dsa-visualizer-main.git)
    cd dsa-visualizer-main
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses standard Node.js package management. You'll need a `package.json` file in your project root which lists dependencies like `react`, `react-dom`, `tailwindcss`, `react-hot-toast`, etc.

    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # OR
    yarn start
    ```
    This will open the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🚀 Usage

Once the development server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

You will see the interactive interface where you can:
* Select a data structure (Singly Linked List, Queue, Basic Tree, etc.).
* Input data using the provided controls.
* Perform operations like insertion, deletion, and (for trees) search.
* Observe the real-time visual changes and animations of the data structure.

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

During development, the team faced several challenges:

* **Dynamic Visualization Logic:** Ensuring smooth and synchronized animations for operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal took significant time and testing.
* **Graph and Tree Layout Complexity:** Visualizing graphs and trees dynamically while maintaining readability and avoiding overlapping nodes/edges posed a significant challenge.
* **Command Parsing:** Implementing a parser to accurately interpret user input from a code editor (e.g., `insert(10)`) into actual operations required careful design to avoid errors and misuse. The team is building a custom parser with error handling and plans to integrate syntax suggestions for better usability.
* **User Input Validation:** Ensuring consistent type and range validation across all inputs. The plan is to reuse and centralize validation functions.
* **Performance:** Rendering large trees or graphs can cause lag. The plan is to introduce a maximum node limit and use `React.Memo` for optimization.
* **Mobile Responsiveness & Scalability:** Ensuring the visualizer works well across different screen sizes while supporting growing structures (like large trees or graphs) remains a challenge. The team is working on responsive designs and zoom/pan features to improve usability.

## ✅ Testing and Validation Status

Extensive testing has been conducted to ensure the reliability of core components:

* **Manual UI Testing:** Passed for Linked List and Queue.
* **Animation Logic:** In Progress; Tree animations are being reviewed.
* **Input Validation:** Passed; Type validation works for arrays/queues.
* **Algorithm Output:** Pending; To be tested for BST, AVL, and Graphs.
